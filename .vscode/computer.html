            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First thing I did was get a prebuilt PC. It was a CyberPower PC and it cost $900
                and was my first legit gaming PC. Straight out of the gate, it was awesome for
                for gaming. Anybody that tells you to build your first PC does not realize
                the amount of wiring and experience you need. I recommend buying a prebuilt
                PC and building upon it.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed that even though this was an awesome PC that ran my favorite games,
                I was still having some problems. I took a look at my task manager and realized my
                memory was being clogged, especially when using Google Chrome. One tab takes 1gb of memory, lmao.
                So I installed new memory RAM sticks. I went from a measly 8gb to 32gb of memory.
                What an upgrade to the quality of life for my PC. This really opened my eyes about computers and
                made me want to learn more. </p>
                
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I got a new computer chip. Went from a Ryzen 5 3600 to a Ryzen
                7 58000x. It did not work when I first installed it. Finally took a look
                at my motherboard. The motherboard was designed only for Ryzen 5 and would not
                allow the Ryzen 7 to run. So I also upgraded the motherboard. Holy mother of jesus. Computer was fast. I was so happy with this purchase.
                I also bought a Cooler Master CPU fan to go along with this.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next I upgraded my PSU box from 550 watts to 850 watts. I think my CPU
                did improve from this as I don't get as many FPS drops or stutters.
                </p>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    Next I want to install a SSD that is going to use KALI Linux and learn about that.
                    Other hardware I plan on getting in the future is a Raspberry PI and see what I can do with this.
                    Other hardware is maybe an external SSD or HDD to write a MAC OS onto and create a Hackintosh.
